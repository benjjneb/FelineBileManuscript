# Reproducible Analyses accompanying the manuscript examining the microbiome of cats with and without biliary disease

This repository hosts the reproducible workflow that performed the analyses presented in the manuscript "16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of bile from healthy cats and cats with suspected hepatobiliary disease" by Slead et al., 2023. Rmarkdown documents are in the Analyses/ directory. You can run these analyses on your own machine by (1) cloning the repository, (2) installing required libraries, and (3) pressing Run!

The Rmarkdown analyses have been rendered into html format, and can be viewed in your web browser:

* [Curation of sequence and sample data](Analyses/FelineBile_Curate.html).
* Investigation of [a core microbiome in feline bile](Analyses/FelineBile_Core.html).
